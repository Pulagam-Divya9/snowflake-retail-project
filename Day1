# Day 1 – Snowflake Environment Setup & Data Staging

## 1. Snowflake Environment

- Created/verified Snowflake account.
- Confirmed trial credits and default role.
- Created an X-Small warehouse with auto-suspend:

SQL:
  CREATE WAREHOUSE IF NOT EXISTS compute_wh
  WITH
    WAREHOUSE_SIZE = 'XSMALL'
    AUTO_SUSPEND = 60
    AUTO_RESUME = TRUE
    INITIALLY_SUSPENDED = TRUE;
- Created project database and schemas:
SQL:
database and schemas:

CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS retail_analytics;

CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS retail_analytics.bronze;
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS retail_analytics.silver;
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS retail_analytics.gold;
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS retail_analytics.technical;

- Dataset Choice: Selected UCI Online Retail II (Kaggle) as the main dataset for:
  - Customer 360
  - Sales analytics
  - Time-series forecasting
  - Anomaly detection
  - AI summarization and vector search.
  - Downloaded the dataset from Kaggle and exported the Excel sheets to a single CSV file:
  - online_retail_II.csv
- Internal Stage & File Upload:
  - Create an internal snowflake stage
CREATE OR REPLACE STAGE retail_analytics.bronze.internal_stage
FILE_FORMAT = (
  TYPE = CSV
  FIELD_OPTIONALLY_ENCLOSED_BY = '"'
  SKIP_HEADER = 1
);
Uploaded online_retail_II.csv to the stage using the Snowflake UI.

Verified the staged file:
LIST @retail_analytics.bronze.internal_stage;
